Dear Network,

I am utterly pleased to announce the completion of our latest project, the Bracho-4, a 16-bit CPU design! ðŸŽ‰ Last week, I successfully desined a fully functional Logisim Evolution circuit, which marks a significant milestone in my journey into computer architecture and digital design.


For those interested, detailed demos and comprehensive documentation of the Bracho-4 can be found here:

    Demos: https://github.com/brachiGH/Bracho-CPU/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#demos
    Usage & Documentation: https://github.com/brachiGH/Bracho-CPU/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#usage--documentation

Looking forward to the next adventure and to applying these learnings in future projects!
